# ReFlowLab

=================



ReFlowLab is a toolkit for the calculation of capital costs of redox flow batteries. 


**Features**

- adaptable redox flow battery database, including:
	- active material properties
	- solvent properties
	- stack component properties
- capital cost calculation, under variation of: 
	- electrolyte
	- stack
	- working point
- full cell as well as half-cell systems consideration in calculation

- Future updates and bug fixes are planned




**Installation**

This project is setup as Maven project. All dependencies are setup by the provided pom file. A compiled version is available on request.



**Documentation**

This tool is part of a publication currently undergoing submission process.
